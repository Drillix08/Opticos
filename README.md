# Opticos Repository Structure

- source/ — source files used to run the Opticos Program
- user_manual/ — PDF explaining everything you need to know about Opticos from an end user's perspective
- extras/ — miscellaneous files that aren't part of the source but we still felt were interesting to include such as animation prototypes and the Opticos logo
